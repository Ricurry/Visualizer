# Audio OpenGL.

## Bare-bones Visualizer.

- #### You will need [VcPKG](https://vcpkg.io/en/index.html), a package manager from Microsoft. We need it to run the software.

Once you have VcPKG installed.

Open your terminal and type:

```bash
vcpkg install glfw3
vcpkg install glm
vcpkg install glad
vcpkg install openal-soft
```

one by one.

## To run:

- Locate the sound.wav file. (This is the audio the software will visualize.)

  - By default this is set to Red Hot Chili Pepper's album;  Can't Stop.

  - Replace with any wav file you'd like, and run the executable.

  - ### Enjoy, if it works. If it doesn't, feel free to file an issue.
